This project is a front-end implementation of a login, registration, and password recovery system. It is designed to be easily integrated with a backend for full functionality.

Features:

User login with basic validation

User registration with password confirmation

Forgot password form with email input

Responsive design using Bootstrap 5

Notes:

This is purely a front-end project.

The code is structured to allow easy modifications for backend integration.

All form submissions currently simulate functionality but do not store any user data.
